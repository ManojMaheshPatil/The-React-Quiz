# The-React-Quiz

A Quiz application built using React (mainly using useReducer and useEffect) with our own internal api for questions.




## Functionalities:

- A Quiz app that you can create with your own set of questions, using your own fake api.
- It has a timer after which the quiz ends.
- A high score functionality that keeps track of the highest score achieved so far .
- A progress bar which indicates the number of questions left , the points that you gained so far and the max possible points of the quiz.


## How to run:

- Enter the code directory.
- Open a terminal and type `npm start` and hit enter. That will launch the react app.
- Now , to run the fake api , open another terminal (do not close the exisiting one) and type `npm run server`. After that open a new tab in the browser of your choice and enter the following URL `http://localhost:9000/questions`. If you see the questions, then it means your own api is running as it should.
